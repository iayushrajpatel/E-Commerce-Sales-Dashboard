# E-Commerce-Sales-Dashboard

Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive E-commerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard analyzes quarter-wise sales results, month-wise profit trends, and category-wise performance to provide clear business insights. Through this project, I practiced data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX, transforming raw sales data into meaningful and actionable insights.
